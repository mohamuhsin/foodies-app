# The Foodies App
> App built with next.js from scratch. check it out [The Foodies App](https://foodies-app-five-olive.vercel.app/).


## How we built it (step by step):
### 1. created three routes and one dynamic route:
> ```
> /meals
> /meals/share
> /community
> /meals/<some slug>
> ```

### 2. Reviting the concept of layouts:
> layouts in nextjs acts as wrappers around pages, we can also have nexted layouts.

### 3. Adding a custom component to a layout:
> We added a Header component, that will be visible in all pages inside the root layout, the root layout also takes meta data like title and description of the app.

### 4. Styling our app using css modules:
> We styled this App using cdd modules, tailwind and the others could also work.

### 5. Optimized Images with the Nextjs Image Component:
> Nextjs recommends its Image component to be used rather than <img />, which helps output images in a more optimized way.
